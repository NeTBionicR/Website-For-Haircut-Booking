Hello! and welcome to my barbershop website Project.

** warning the project is in french**

To run this project, you will need a coding editor such as Visual Studio code or WebStorm

here are the steps to open up the project :

 -open a terminal in the right directory of the project (that would be /projet)

- run the command :

npm install express knex SQLite body-parser cors

- and then when the installation is done, run the command :

node serveur.js

- once that is done, go on any web browser and type :

http://localhost:3000/

you should then be on the main page of the Project
